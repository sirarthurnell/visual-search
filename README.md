Visual Search is a small web application that let's you search a topic and shows you a small information about it and some of the most recent pictures about it. It's created using Vue and ES6.

## Usage
Simply clone it and execute `npm run serve` (supposing you have the Vue CLI installed already). After that, search for a topic and press enter.
